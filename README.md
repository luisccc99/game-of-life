# Game Of Life
The game of life is a zero player game Conway's Game of Life it's a "no-player never-ending game." it only needs an initial state and some rules to evolve.
In an orthogonal grid, you can place any number of live cells and see them evolve with the following rules:  
- Birth. A dead (empty) cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.
- Dead. A cell dies if it has less than two (boredom) or more than three (overpopulation) neighbors.  
- Survival. It survives if it has two or three neighbors.  
Some cells will die and be born or even make some weird interactions to form different patterns.
